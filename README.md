# TODOCLI
The project first started as a side projects to learn about python programming by making a simple todo list app that runs in the terminal, with basic functionality such as:

## 1. Adding A task
Add a task flawlessly and also track them using date system with dates, month, year. There is no built - in deadline functionality, though it serves the most basic adding a task feature.
## 2. View A task
Let's say you have successfully added your task, now it's time to view them, to check wether everything alright or wanna see the progress by looking at the built - in status code (Completed or Not Completed Yet).
## 3. Mark Task as Completed
The last feature does basicly how it was named. Complete a task? Mark it as completed!

## Later iteration (current iteration) of the project are simply the re-written version of the python one, with a twist. It's written using C++, and more feature are awaiting to be built soon.
